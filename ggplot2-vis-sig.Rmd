# Grammar of graphics

## Data visualization

> *"The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst's mind than any other device." --- John Tukey*

- Data visualization is the creation and study of the visual representation of data
- Many tools for visualizing data -- R is one of them
- Many approaches/systems within R for making data visualizations -- **ggplot2** is one of them, and that's what we're going to use

---

## What is grammar of graphics?

.pull-left[
- Describes the fundamental features that underlie all statistical graphics
- Crated by Leland Wilkinson

.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}

## High level overview

.pull-left[
- Graphic **map**s the **data** to the **aes**thetic attributes (colour, shape, size) of **geom**etric shapes (points, lines, bars)
- Plot may also include **stat**istical transformations of the data,  information about the **coord**inate system, and the **theme**
- **Facet**ting can be used to plot for different subsets of the data
- Combination of these independent components make up a graphic

## Composition of a plot

All plots are composed of

- the **data**: the information you want to visualise
- a **mapping**: the description of how the data’s variables are mapped to aesthetic attributes

---

## Mapping 

- **layer**: Collection of **geom**etric elements (what you actually see in the plot: points, lines, polygons, etc.) and statistical transformations (**stats**) (e.g. binning and counting observations to create a histogram, or fitting a linear model)

--

- **scales**: Mapping of values in the data space to values in the aesthetic space (e.g. use of colour, shape, size) as well as the inverse mapping (e.g. legends, axes, etc. to make it possible to read the original data values from the plot)

--

- **coord**inate system: Mapping of data coordinates to the plane of the graphic and provides axes and gridlines to help read the graph (e.g. Cartesian, polar, map projections, etc.)

--

- **facet**: Specifies how to break up and display subsets of data as small multiples

--

- **theme**: Controls the finer points of display (e.g. font size, background color) and is customizable

## Mass vs. height

```{r mass-height, out.width = "50%"}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Mass vs. height of Starwars characters",
       x = "Height (cm)", y = "Weight (kg)")
```

---

.question[ 
- What are the functions doing the plotting?
- What is the dataset being plotted?
- Which variables map to which features (aesthetics) of the plot?
- What does the warning mean?<sup>+</sup>

```{r ref.label="mass-height", fig.show = "hide"}

## ggplot2 $\in$ tidyverse

.pull-left[
- `gg` in "ggplot2" stands for Grammar of Graphics 
- It's built based on the **grammar of graphics**
- **ggplot2** is tidyverse's data visualization package

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

# or
library(ggplot2)
```
] 
.pull-right[ 
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}

## Hello ggplot2!

- `ggplot()` is the main function in ggplot2
- Plots are constructed in layers
- Structure of the code for plots can be summarized as

```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = [dataset], 
       mapping = aes(x = [x-variable], y = [y-variable])) +
   geom_xxx() +
   other options
```

- `size`
- `alpha` (transparency)

```
]

---

## Mapping vs. setting

- **Mapping:** Determine the size, alpha, etc. of points based on the values of a variable in the data
  - goes into `aes()`

- **Setting:** Determine the size, alpha, etc. of points **not** based on the values of a variable in the data
  - goes into `geom_*()` (this was `geom_point()` in the previous example, but we'll learn about other geoms soon!)

## Various ways to facet

.question[
In the next few slides describe what each plot displays. Think about how the code relates to the output.

**Note:** The plots in the next few slides do not have proper titles, axis labels, etc. because we want you to figure out what's happening in the plots.
But you should always label your plots!

```{r warning = FALSE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(species ~ sex) #<<
```

---

```{r warning = FALSE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(sex ~ species) #<<
```

---

```{r warning = FALSE, fig.asp = 0.5}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ species) #<<
```

---

```{r warning = FALSE, fig.asp = 0.5}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(. ~ species) #<<
```

---

```{r warning = FALSE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ species, ncol = 2) #<<
```

## Faceting summary

- `facet_grid()`:
    - 2d grid
    - `rows ~ cols`
    - use `.` for no split
- `facet_wrap()`: 1d ribbon wrapped according to number of rows and columns specified or available plotting area

## Facet and color

.pull-left-narrow[
```{r facet-color-legend, fig.show = "hide", warning = FALSE}
ggplot(
  penguins, 
  aes(x = bill_depth_mm, 
      y = bill_length_mm, 
      color = species)) + #<<
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(species ~ sex) +
  scale_color_viridis_d() #<<
```
]
.pull-right-wide[
```{r ref.label = "facet-color-legend", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
```
]

---

## Face and color, no legend

.pull-left-narrow[
```{r facet-color-no-legend, fig.show = "hide", warning = FALSE}
ggplot(
  penguins, 
  aes(x = bill_depth_mm, 
      y = bill_length_mm, 
      color = species)) +
  geom_point(show.legend = FALSE) + #<<
  facet_grid(species ~ sex) +
  scale_color_viridis_d()
```
]
.pull-right-wide[
```{r ref.label = "facet-color-no-legend", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
```

## What is grammar of graphics is **not**?

- It doesn’t suggest which graphics to use

- It doesn’t describe interactive graphics, only static ones
